# Fireball Fiasco
A game where you play a clumsy wizard that has to dodge his own magic, made with [Zefir Engine](https://github.com/thomascsigai/Zefir).
Made by Thomas Csigai and Valentin Lequeux for the [Unconventional Game Engine Jam](https://itch.io/jam/unconventional-game-engine-jam).

## Gameplay

You control a wizard in a chaotic environment where every spell you cast comes back to haunt you.  
Dodge, roll, and avoid your own magical fireballs while trying to stay alive for as long as possible. The game gets more intense as the number of fireballs increases — will you survive the chaos?
